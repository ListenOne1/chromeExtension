# Overview

I made a calculator in the chrome extension. Sometimes I need to use the calculation, but I need to take time to pull out my calculator. So I decided to create a calculator in the chrome extension. The purpose of writing this program is to save a little bit of time for some simple calculations.

This program can do simple Arithmetic including Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
